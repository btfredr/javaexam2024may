    Task 6. (35 points)
    The task is to create a Java program that supports the classification of employees in an entertaining
    company.

    • Task 6.1: Create a Class Named CompanyEmployee (4 points)
    • Create a class named CompanyEmployee that contains data fields for the employee
    ID, first name, last name, and age. Include getter and setter methods for these fields.

    • Task 6.2: Constructors for CompanyEmployee (3 points)
    • The CompanyEmployee class should have two constructors:
    • One constructor with three arguments (ID, firstName, lastName).
    • Another with four arguments (ID, firstName, lastName, age).

    • Task 6.3: Print Method for CompanyEmployee (3 points)
    • Implement a print method in the CompanyEmployee class that outputs a message
    about the first name, last name, and age of the employee.

    • Task 6.4: Create Two Subclasses: Actors and Directors (4 points)
    • Develop two subclasses that extend the CompanyEmployee class. These subclasses
    should be named Actors and Directors.
    
    • Task 6.5: Additional Fields in the Actors Subclass (1 point)
    • The Actors subclass should include:
    • A field that holds the main genre the actor typically performs in (e.g., drama,
    comedy).
    • A field that indicates whether the actor is currently available for new roles.

    • Task 6.6: Constructor for Actors (3 points)
    • Actors should have an additional constructor that updates the two new fields in
    addition to the constructor from the superclass.

    • Task 6.7: Methods in Actors (3 points)
    • Add methods getGenre and isAvailable that read and return the values of the fields
    genre and available, respectively. 

    • Task 6.8: Override Print Method in Actors (3 points)
    • Override the print method from the superclass to create a method in the Actors class
    that prints information from all available fields.

    • Task 6.9: Additional Field in the Directors Subclass (2 points)
    • The Directors subclass should contain an additional field that stores the name of the
    last movie directed.

    • Task 6.10: Polymorphic Print Methods in Directors (4 points)
    • Use polymorphism to create two methods in the Directors class to print information
    about the directors:
    • One method should print only the first name and last name.
    • The other method should print all available information, including the last
    movie directed.

    • Task 6.11: Test Class with Main Method (5 points)
    • Create a simple Test class with a main method, that will create instances of one
    Actor and one Director and print details from both.
    
    Pay attention to the use of access modifiers and the readability of the code. During the assessment
    of this task, special attention will be focused on the ability to implement fundamental principles of
    object-oriented programming: inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
